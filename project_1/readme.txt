Type of fmt prints:-
Printf: Custom formats a string using one or more verbs, which are placeholders for named values. Unlike Println, Printf does not append a newline. 
Print: Takes no format and is equivalent to saying %v for every operand. 
Println: Inserts blanks between operands and appends a newline. 
Sprintf: Functions the same way as Printf, but returns the formatted input string instead of printing on the output console. 
Sprintln: Functions the same way as Println, but returns the input string instead of printing on the output console. 
Sprint: Formats using the default formats for its operands and returns the resulting string.
